# How It Works

1.The application requests permission to access the user’s location.
2.Upon approval, the browser detects the latitude and longitude.
3.JavaScript sends these coordinates to the Weather API.
4.The API returns real-time weather information.
5.The weather details are dynamically displayed on the user interface.
